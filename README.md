# Portfolio
Data Science Portfolio - DTU Projects

## Whisper Speech Recognition
- Retrained a Large Speech Recognition Model with Transformers and hyper-tuned it for better performance on zero-shots DataSets
- Used PyTorch, CUDA and Deep Learning Architectures
- Used HuggingFace for Loading and Storing Deep Learning Models & Large Datasets

## Text and web mining on news articles and tweets
- Modelled sentiment analysis on >20 Million tweets with Vader Library in Python
- Collected, aggregated and transformed > 5 GB of Tweets Data. 
- Clustered topics of various articles using Latent Dirichlet Allocation for finding similarities
- Predicted media bias using Word2Vec, to obtain vectorial representations of articles

## Machine Learning Operations - Movie Recommendations
- Deployed a Deep Learning Graph Neural Network recommendation System on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP), using Docker, Vertex
- Trained models in GCP using Vertex AI
- Created a data storage in GCP Bucket for storing data and models
- Create a FastAPI application for exposing the model`s inference and triggering workflows for automatically building docker images


## AirBnB Forecasting
- Used Apache PySpark for processing massive Data Sets (> 5GB) and visualising insights 
- Modelled words sentiment analysis with PySpark & Pandas for reviews by giving scores to words, based on a mathematical model
- Performed Scalability experiments on Spark Technology, by analysing non-linear relationship between data size and computation time, and optimising computational complexity
